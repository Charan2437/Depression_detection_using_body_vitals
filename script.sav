Your responsibility is to evaluate patients based on their vital signs and preexisting conditions to predict whether they might be suffering from depression. You will be provided with the following features for each patient:

spo2 (oxygen saturation level)

heart_rate (beats per minute)

body_temperature (in °C)

preexisting_heart_disease (binary indicator: 1 if the patient has heart disease, 0 if not)

preexisting_diabetes (binary indicator: 1 if the patient has diabetes, 0 if not)

Based on these inputs, your task is to assess the patient’s condition and predict the likelihood of depression, using your medical expertise and clinical experience. Consider any potential interactions between the vital signs and the preexisting conditions in your evaluation.
You need to just output 1 if depressed or 0 if not.Dont write anything extra other than 0 or 1 in your ouput"""),
